# Boolean Functions and Gate Logic Roadmap
ohhh reminds me college electrical engineering class...
Since I know all the lgoic gates and how it works (experimented with chips, light bulbs, etc), I won't make all the logic gate.

## Boolean Logic

0       1
true    false
on      off

Ways to express Boolean Functions
Boolean Expression <=> Truth Table (Can convert both way)

f(x, y, z) = (x AND y) OR (NOT(x) AND z)
        ^
        |
        âŒ„
x | y | z | f
0 | 0 | 0 | 0
0 | 0 | 1 | 1
    .
    .  
    .
Converting Boolean Expression to Truth Table is straight forward.
How about converting Truth Table to Boolea Expression?
First, focus on the result that is 1. Make expressions that gives 1 in the Truth Table.
Second, now we have bunch of different expressions. Do OR all the expressions.
Third, make it simpler/shorter/efficient.

De Morgan's Laws:
1. The complement of a conjunction (AND) is the disjunction (OR) of the complements:
NOT(x AND y) = NOT(x) OR NOT(y)

2. The complement of a disjunction (OR) is the conjunction (AND) of the complements:
NOT(x or y) = NOT(x) AND NOT(y)

#### NAND function (NOT(x AND y))
x | y | NAND
0 | 0 | 1
0 | 1 | 1
1 | 0 | 1
1 | 1 | 0


## Hardware Description Language (HDL)
I remember I really enjoyed this when I was in college.

Language that describes implementation of a chip. ex) OR(a=aAndnotb, b=notaAndb, out=out)
Interface is uniqude, but implementation is not. 

-VHDL
-Verilog
-Many more...

## Hardware Simulation
Helps verifing HDL program. Script based simulation, one file is HDL, the other is test file.

## Multi-Bit Buses

##### Multiplexor
a-|\
    -- out
b-|/
   |
   sel
if (sel = 0) 
    out = a
else
    out = b

Another example is AndMuxOr
when sel is 0, And gate
otherwise, Or gate

##### Demultiplexor
     / -- a 
in --
     \ -- b
    |
    sel
if (sel == 0)
    {a, b} = {in, 0}
else
    {a, b} = {0, in}

##### And 16
a --(16) -- |
            |D -- (16)--out
b --(16) -- |
16 bit buses

a = 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 ..
b = 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 ..
out=0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 ..

##### Mux4Way16
Multi-way variant
(all 16 bit bus in)
a--|\
b--|  \     -- out 16 bit
c--|  /
d--|/ |
      |
      sel (2)
sel1 sel2  out
  0     0   a
  0     1   b
  1     0   c
  1     1   d
